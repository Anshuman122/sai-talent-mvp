# üèÖ AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Democratizing Sports Talent Assessment  
### Team Loud (ID: 64517)

## üìå Introduction & Problem Context
India possesses vast, untapped athletic talent, especially in rural and remote regions. However, systemic issues‚Äîprimarily high costs, lack of infrastructure, and reliance on subjective, manual scouting‚Äîhave historically prevented this talent from being discovered.

This project offers an innovative solution by transforming the low-cost smartphone into a professional-grade, standardized, and unbiased tool for athletic assessment. By harnessing **Edge AI (TinyML)** and **Computer Vision**, we decentralize the talent discovery process, ensuring that every athlete is evaluated purely on their dedication and performance, regardless of their location or financial status. This creates a genuine level playing field, which is critical for India's sporting future.

## üöÄ Current Achievements & System Status

### Offline-First Mobile Application  
- Developed using **Flutter/Dart** for seamless, single-codebase deployment on Android and iOS.  
- The core assessment logic runs fully offline, ensuring accessibility in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.

### Edge AI Deployment  
- All AI models are successfully converted, optimized, and deployed in the **TensorFlow Lite (<50MB)** format.  
- Achieves reliable, real-time inference on common low-end smartphones.

### Comprehensive Model Suite  
- Full array of activity-specific, validated biomechanical models for standardized fitness tests.

### Robust Security  
- Multi-layered **Cheat Detection pipeline** operational, protecting data integrity against video manipulation and performance fraud.

### Scalable Backend  
- Built on secure, decoupled, and containerized microservices ready to handle massive, concurrent result loads from a nationwide user base.

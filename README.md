# AI-Powered Mobile Platform for Democratizing Sports Talent Assessment

## Introduction & Problem Context
India possesses vast, untapped athletic talent, especially in rural and remote regions. However, systemic issuesâ€”primarily high costs, lack of infrastructure, and reliance on subjective, manual scoutingâ€”have historically prevented this talent from being discovered.

This project offers an innovative solution by transforming the low-cost smartphone into a professional-grade, standardized, and unbiased tool for athletic assessment. By harnessing **Edge AI (TinyML)** and **Computer Vision**, we decentralize the talent discovery process, ensuring that every athlete is evaluated purely on their dedication and performance, regardless of their location or financial status. This creates a genuine level playing field, which is critical for India's sporting future.

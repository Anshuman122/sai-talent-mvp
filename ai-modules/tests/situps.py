"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   MediaPipe Pose was successfully used to detect shoulder and hip landmarks in video frames, and the Euclidean distance between the midpoints was used as a measure of torso length.
*   Missing landmark data was handled through interpolation, and the torso length signal was normalized.
*   A Savitzky-Golay filter with a window size of 51 and a polynomial order of 3 was applied to smooth the normalized torso signal.
*   Automatic thresholds for sit-up detection were calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the smoothed signal (lower threshold = 0.3227, upper threshold = 0.5704).
*   A state machine was implemented to count sit-ups by tracking the signal crossing the defined thresholds, resulting in a total count of 17.
*   The pose skeleton, sit-up count, and state were successfully overlaid onto the video frames, and the processed video was saved as `output_situps.mp4`.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   Experiment with different window sizes and polynomial orders for the Savitzky-Golay filter to potentially improve the smoothing and threshold calculation for better sit-up detection accuracy.
*   Consider adding a calibration step at the beginning of the video to automatically determine optimal thresholds based on the user's starting and ending sit-up positions.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The input video had dimensions 640x360, with a frame rate of 30 FPS and a total of 1576 frames.
*   MediaPipe BlazePose was successfully used to extract pose landmarks (shoulders, hips, ankles) for each frame.
*   A raw torso signal was calculated based on the vertical distance between the average shoulder and hip y-coordinates.
*   Missing signal values due to failed pose detection were handled using linear interpolation.
*   The raw torso signal was smoothed using a Savitzky–Golay filter.
*   Peak and trough detection on the smoothed signal, combined with a state machine and realistic cycle duration constraints (0.4s to 6s), identified a total of 17 sit-up cycles.
*   Cheating detection checks for duplicate frames, framerate anomalies, pose motion sanity (large signal jumps, too-fast cycles), background motion, and low landmark confidence were implemented.
*   Based on the analysis, no unique frames were flagged for any of the implemented cheating detection categories in the provided video.
*   Audio consistency analysis was noted as being skipped due to limitations of the execution environment.
*   A text summary report and a CSV report (`summary_report.csv`) were generated, confirming the total sit-up count (17) and stating that no unique frames were flagged for cheating.
*   An output video (`situp_output.mp4`) was generated with overlaid pose skeletons, sit-up count, and state.
*   A signal plot (`situp_signal.png`) was generated showing the smoothed torso signal, marked sit-up counts, and markers for potential anomalies (though none were found in this specific analysis).

### Insights or Next Steps

*   While no cheating was detected in this specific video, the implemented framework provides a solid foundation for analyzing other videos where anomalies might be present.
*   To enhance the cheating detection, further refinement of thresholds and potentially more sophisticated methods for background motion analysis (e.g., masking the pose) and pose motion sanity (e.g., joint angle analysis) could be explored. Robust audio analysis would require a different execution environment or approach.

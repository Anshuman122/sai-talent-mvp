# Task
Implement a Python script in a single Colab cell that accepts a video upload (.mp4 or .avi) of a person performing shuttle runs, uses MediaPipe BlazePose for pose estimation to track hips, shoulders, and feet, calculates the body center from the hips, implements a state machine with dynamic boundaries and U-V tracking logic to count shuttle runs (U) and a live distance multiplier (V), overlays U and V (and optionally landmarks, trajectory, and boundaries) on the video frames, saves the annotated output video, prints the final U and V values, and saves a CSV/JSON log of frame timestamps, state transitions, and completed shuttle counts.

"""**Reasoning**:
The error indicates that the 'state' column is not present in `df_filtered` when attempting to merge it with `df_runs`. This happened because the 'state' column was added to `df_filtered` in a previous subtask, but the state machine logic was re-initialized and re-run in this single cell, and the 'state' column was not added back to `df_filtered` in this consolidated script's execution flow before the merge for annotation. I need to add the state column back to the `df_filtered` DataFrame after the state machine logic has been applied in this combined script.

"""### Explanation:

The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Setup and Video Loading**: Installs the necessary libraries and loads the uploaded video file, extracting its properties.
2.  **Pose Estimation and Body Center Calculation**: Uses MediaPipe BlazePose to detect pose landmarks, specifically focusing on the hips to calculate the body center for each frame.
3.  **Dynamic Boundary Detection**: Analyzes the calculated body center positions to determine the minimum and maximum x-coordinates, which are used as the dynamic left and right boundaries for the shuttle run area.
4.  **Shuttle Run State Machine Implementation, Noise Filtering, and U-V Counting Logic**: Iterates through the body center data, implements a state machine to track movement between the defined boundaries, applies noise filtering based on minimum displacement to avoid spurious transitions, and counts completed shuttle runs (U) and updates the distance multiplier (V) based on the state transitions.
5.  **Video Annotation and Output Video Saving**: Re-reads the video frames, overlays the detected pose landmarks, the body center trajectory, the dynamic boundary lines, and the live U and V values as text on each frame. The annotated frames are then written to a new video file.
6.  **Analytics and Reporting**: Prints the final calculated U and V values, saves the state transition data and run completion data to CSV and JSON files respectively, and generates a plot showing the cumulative shuttle run count over time.

To use this script:

1.  Ensure you have uploaded a video file (MP4 or AVI) of a person performing shuttle runs in a previous cell execution in the same Colab session. The script assumes the `uploaded` variable is available.
2.  Run the code cell.
3.  The script will process the video and save the annotated output video (`annotated_[your_video_filename].mp4`), a CSV file (`shuttle_run_transitions.csv`) containing state transitions, and a JSON file (`shuttle_run_runs.json`) containing completed run details.
4.  The final U and V values will be printed, and a plot will be displayed showing the cumulative shuttle run count over time.

If you still encounter issues opening the video, you might need to try a different video player or explore other codec options for `cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc`.

## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The script successfully loaded the uploaded video and extracted its properties (filename, FPS, frame width, frame height).
*   MediaPipe BlazePose was used to perform pose estimation and extract hip landmarks for each frame.
*   The body center was calculated as the midpoint of the hip landmarks.
*   Dynamic left and right boundaries for the shuttle run were determined based on the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of the detected body centers across all frames.
*   A state machine with states `AT_LEFT`, `MOVING_RIGHT`, `AT_RIGHT`, and `MOVING_LEFT` was implemented to track the person's movement.
*   Noise filtering was applied to the state transitions by requiring a minimum displacement from the position of the last transition to prevent spurious state changes due to small oscillations.
*   Shuttle runs (U) were counted based on the state transitions, specifically when the person returned to a side they had previously been at (completing a round trip).
*   The distance multiplier (V) was calculated as twice the number of completed shuttle runs (V = U * 2).
*   The video frames were annotated with:
    *   MediaPipe pose landmarks.
    *   A trajectory of the body center.
    *   Vertical lines representing the dynamically determined left and right boundaries.
    *   Text overlays showing the current state, shuttle run count (U), and distance multiplier (V) for each frame.
*   The annotated video was saved to a file.
*   A log of state transitions (frame index, state, timestamp) was saved to a CSV file.
*   A log of completed runs (frame index, state indicating completion side, timestamp) was saved to a JSON file.
*   A plot showing the cumulative shuttle run count (U) over time was generated.
*   The final calculated values for U and V were printed to the console. Based on the provided process results, the final U was 1 and V was 2.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The current run counting logic defines a run as a round trip (returning to the starting side). Depending on the specific definition of a "shuttle run" required (e.g., touch the line at each end), the counting logic might need refinement.
*   The dynamic boundary detection relies on the person reaching the full extent of the shuttle run area within the analyzed frames. If the video starts or ends mid-run, or if the person doesn't utilize the full space, the boundaries might be inaccurate. Considering alternative methods like manual calibration or analyzing a specific calibration phase could improve accuracy.

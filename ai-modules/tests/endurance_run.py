"""# Task
Analyze a running video for endurance metrics and potential cheating, including pose estimation, distance/speed calculation, fatigue detection, and visualization of results. Optionally, use GPS data for more accurate distance and speed.

## Environment setup

### Subtask:
Install necessary libraries (mediapipe, opencv-python-headless, etc.). Detect GPU availability and print environment information.

**Reasoning**:
The first step is to install the necessary libraries using pip.
"""

"""**Reasoning**:
Now that the libraries are installed, I will check for GPU availability and print the versions of the key installed libraries and the Python version as requested in the instructions.

"""## Cheating Analysis Report

Based on the analysis of the provided video, a cheating analysis was conducted. The following potential indicators of cheating or manipulation were checked:

*   **Frame Inconsistencies (Frame Drops):** Checks for missing frames in the video sequence.
*   **Pose Motion Sanity:** Analyzes sudden and unrealistic jumps in key pose landmark positions between consecutive frames.
*   **Background Motion Analysis:** A basic check for significant changes in overall frame content that might indicate cuts or manipulations (using mean pixel intensity difference).
*   **GPS Consistency:** (If GPS data is provided) Checks for implausible speeds or inconsistencies in GPS location data.
*   **Landmark Confidence:** (If confidence scores are available) Checks for sudden drops in the confidence scores of detected landmarks.
*   **Audio Inconsistencies:** (Optional, not implemented in this analysis) Could include checks for long silences, desync, etc.

The analysis identified potential anomalies, and a score was calculated for each frame based on the detected inconsistencies. These frame-level scores were used to derive an overall cheating probability.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   No GPU was detected or available for processing.
*   A video file ("How to ｜ Shuttle Run.mp4") was successfully uploaded and analyzed. No GPS data file was provided.
*   The video has a resolution of 1280x720 pixels, runs at 23.976 FPS, and contains 360 frames.
*   Pose landmarks (shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, feet) were successfully extracted for frames where a pose was detected.
*   Per-frame metrics like stride length and torso tilt were calculated from pose landmarks.
*   Due to the lack of GPS data, distance and speed were estimated using video analysis based on detected stride length. The estimated average speed was approximately 1.05 pixels/s, and the total cumulative distance was approximately 158 pixels.
*   Endurance metrics were calculated: Cadence was approximately 47.95 steps/min (based on right ankle peaks), estimated VO2 Max was calculated as 10.0 (using a placeholder conversion), and the Consistency Index (std deviation of stride length) was approximately 0.035.
*   Fatigue detection, based on a 10% reduction in rolling average stride length, did not detect fatigue in this video.
*   Several checks for potential cheating/anomalies were performed:
    *   No missing frames were detected.
    *   102 potential pose jumps (sudden changes in landmark positions) were detected.
    *   No significant background changes were detected using a simple mean intensity check.
    *   GPS speed anomalies were skipped as no GPS data was used.
    *   Landmark confidence checks were skipped as confidence scores were not stored.
*   An overall cheating analysis resulted in an average frame anomaly score of 0.2833 and a cheating probability of 0.1139 based on the proportion of frames with detected anomalies.
*   A processed video with overlays showing estimated speed, distance, cadence, and anomaly warnings was successfully generated.
*   Plots visualizing instantaneous speed, stride length, and cumulative distance over time were created and saved.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The estimated VO2 Max and distance/speed based purely on video pixels are highly uncalibrated. Future steps should include a method to calibrate pixel measurements to real-world units if no GPS data is available (e.g., by measuring a known distance in the video scene).
*   The current step detection for cadence is simplified. Implementing a more robust step counting algorithm (e.g., analyzing vertical displacement peaks or temporal gait analysis) would improve the accuracy of cadence and potentially distance estimation from video.
